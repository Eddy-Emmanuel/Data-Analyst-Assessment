-- Q2: Transaction Frequency Analysis
-- Objective: Categorize customers into "High", "Medium", or "Low" frequency
-- based on how often they make transactions every month on average.

-- Calculate total number of transactions per customer and how many months they've been active
WITH customer_monthly_txn AS (
    SELECT
        sa.owner_id,  -- customer ID
        COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,  -- total number of transactions done by this customer
        
        -- Calculate how many months theyâ€™ve been transacting (difference between earliest and latest transaction date)
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, MIN(sa.transaction_date), MAX(sa.transaction_date)) + 1 AS active_months
        
        -- I added +1 to avoid dividing by zero, especially if transaction dates fall within the same month
